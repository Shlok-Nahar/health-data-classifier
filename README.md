# Health Data Classifier

This project builds a machine learning model to classify health data between two individuals: Shlok and Akhil.

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Output of `extract_data.py`
```
Exported 224,397 records to 'data/shlok.csv' with person='shlok'.
Exported 5,063,078 records to 'data/akhil.csv' with person='akhil'.
Combined both CSVs into 'data/raw_data.csv'.
```

### Output of `process_data.py`
```
Exported 224,397 records to 'data/downsampled.csv' with person='shlok'.
Exported 224,397 records to 'data/downsampled.csv' with person='akhil'.
